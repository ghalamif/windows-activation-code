# windows-activation-code
with this script you can get the windows activation code
Make sure when youâ€™re saving the script that you have the Save as type option set to All Files (*.*), otherwise it will just save as a text document.
Now you can run the script from wherever you just saved it and a box should pop up displaying your product key. Take a picture of it on your phone or write it down somewhere safe.
